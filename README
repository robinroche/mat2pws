mat2pws
By Robin Roche, University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, France


CONCEPT

This project is a basic interface between Matlab and PowerWorld Simulator with SimAuto. 
It is based on the documentation of PowerWorld Simulator, and extends the examples provided.
It can be easily tested and modified.


REQUIREMENTS

To use mat2pws, you need:
- Matlab (tested with R2011b).
- PowerWorld Simulator with the SimAuto add-on, that provides COM connectivity. 


SETUP

I assume you already have Matlab and PowerWorld Simulator installed.

1. Get the mat2pws files.
2. Run the main.m file.
3. The communication should then be established and data should be exchanged. You should see things displaying in the console. If not, you have a problem somewhere.


FILES

main.m: The test file for Matlab.
ieee14.PWB: A test case created in PowerWorld Simulator. 


USING mat2pws

These file are free to use.
I only ask you to cite one of my papers if you use it, especially for research: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2012.9
No extensive testing has been done, so use it at your own risk. 
If you find bugs, errors, etc., or want to contribute, please let me know.
